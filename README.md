# MachineLearningCourse
Personal repository of work in progress for Machine Learning course.
Below is a "study list" that I need to maintain to keep on top of all the material covered in this 9 week class.
Something tells me I'll be studying this material long after the class ends on August 17, 2018.

## Reference materials
A list of all the videos, documents, and books I review/use can be found here:
